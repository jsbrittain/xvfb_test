# xvfb_test

Here, we use a (debian-based) mambaforge container to install and run Tracer (for BEAST analyses) in a headless environment. Screenshots are returned to a `screenshots` folder periodically.

Launch the container with:
`./run.sh`

Note that you may need to change the `docker` alias at the start of the script if you are using `podman` (or similar).
